## Challenge
- On your desktop, create a directory (folder) and name it whatever you'd like.
  - Within that folder, create 2 more directories (folders) named `folder-one` and `folder two` (exactly like this looks with the first having a "dash" and the other a "space" between the two words.
  - Within `folder-one`, create 2 `txt` files in one command.
    - These files should be named:
      - `first.txt`, `second.txt`, and `third.txt`

**Bonus:** Research what is needed in order to open the **explorer window** (*opens in a window to see the list of files within the GUI*)
